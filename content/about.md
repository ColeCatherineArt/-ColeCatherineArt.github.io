Also known by many pseudonyms, Cole is an artist currently conceiving pieces from Portland, Oregon.
Cole's first print was sold at the **Canon Art Collective Benefit** in 2003, an event that took place in Beavercreek, Ohio.
The event was coordinated by friends of Cole to help raise funds for expenses of a life altering surgery, an affliction that severely impaired Cole at age 18. They regard that experience as an inspiration.

On August 31st & September 1st, 2012 their work was exhibited at **The Pancakes & Booze Art Show** (Portland, OR), their first collaborative exhibition.
Shortly after learning how to work with clay as a medium their first ceramic piece was shown in the **Cascade gallery** at PCC during the 2013 student show.
In May, 2013 Cole donated a painting to the **I Heart Art Foundation** and it was auctioned off for a fundraiser at Portland Art Museum and its proceeds were placed in a scholarship fund for low-income art students.

It wasn't until Cole produced a piece entailing an image of an anatomical heart for their aunt, that their longest running theme was solidified, though in recent years they have stepped away from that as their primary artistic theme, however every so often an anatomical heart will present itself in their projects.
Cole received a Scholastic Key Award for photography at the age of 16 and a runner up award from a contest at The Great Frame Up in Wheeling, IL circa 2002.
They are also a published poet and has a digital design background but in recent years their creativity has broadened its focus to a wide range of artistic endeavors and they have been known to dabble in nearly any type of creative medium that strikes their fancy. They also have become a muse of sorts for many other artists through their work as a professional Fine Art Life Model. Working with many professional artists, art groups, art students and instructors within academic settings.  
Though their artworks range from influences of “Sci-fi & fantasy, space...the stuff within space (existence)”, conceptually her work always returns to the heart from which it came.
Inspiration also comes in the form of travel and life experiences (to which they boast many a harrowing tale, joyful accounts and everything in between).
Albeit, stylistic similarities are thin, a few of the artists Cole has gleamed inspiration from are Van Gogh, Robert & Beverly Spotts, Catherine Anne Allison, and Ruth Jane Williams. Ruth was Cole's grandmother who instilled a deep-rooted love of art within Cole from a young age, and they have received training in art history, techniques and is skilled in a variety of mediums.
